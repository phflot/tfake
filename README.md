# T-FAKE: Synthesizing Thermal Images for Facial Landmarking


## Downloading the dataset

To download the color images for the dataset, please use the links in the [FaceSynthetics repository](https://github.com/microsoft/FaceSynthetics).

Our dataset has been generated for a warm and for a cold condition. Each dataset can be downloaded separately as

- A small sample with 100 images from [here warm]() and [here cold]()
- A medium sample with 1000 images from [here warm]() and [here cold]()
- The full dataset with 100,000 images from [here warm]() and [here cold]()

## Using the landmarker

Coming soon.
